# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Life of a College Girl 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project will be a visual novel that we code, centered around a girl navigating her college life while encountering challenges, milestones and unexpected twists. Including a player-based game where viewers can determine her end goal. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project will be an interactive visual novel where players can guide a college girl through key moments and decisions of her college experience. The choices that players make will affect the storyline, leading to different story outcomes and endings. There will be options for viewers to make decisions, character visuals and detailed backgrounds. We have to do additional research for a platform of choice, but Ren’Py or Python are both options. The goal is for them to allow features such as player engagement, decision making and storytelling. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Indiya Johnson, (tuo61023@temple.edu), Parsa Esmaeilkhani 
Jasmine Miller, (tup84905@temple.edu), Kora Sen 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- A fully functional visual novel with a complete story from beginning to end. 

- Basic visuals to pair with the story 
   - Text boxes > Ren’Py has this function (research) 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If we have the opportunity to, build an interactive story-based project that allows viewers to choose the characters choices: 
Many story endings based on decisions chosen 
Better visuals  
Saving settings (maybe) 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A fully completed story line from beginning to end with complex visuals beyond just a character and background. If we only have one story line shoot for a longer story. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps would be outlining the main storyline, the characters and looking into our platform of choice, so we can do research on how to properly build our project. The quicker we learn how to do the base level of this project the more time we have to expand into an interactive story-based game (which would be ideal). This following week we plan on picking our platform of choice, have a finalize storyline and character line up prepared, so after the week ends, we can start to code of visual novel. As far as splitting up the work, right now it would be ideal if we look into platforms together to see what works for the both of us. Also, for the storyline we should work together so we both understand our story and the options that can happen (being on the same understanding throughout the project). Afterwards we will spilt up tasks.
